                    <p class="role">Backend Software Engineering Intern at Boeing</p>
                    <p style="font-style: italic">June - September 2023</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I implemented the new design for a small-scale data manager using messaging API</li>
                        <li>Improved the design of the configuration framework by 5% with more robust exception handling</li>
                        <li>Skills: AWS (containerized development), Github, C++, unit testing</li>
                    </ul>

                    Thoughts: I appreciate it. It was my first internship, and I'd like to explore other tech stacks.
                            And work at a tech company!

                <!-- DATA PROGRAMMING PROJECT -->
                <div class="box item">
                    <p class="role">Data Programming Class Project Lead</p>
                    <p style="font-style: italic">May - June 2023</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Researched data sets on housing prices, planned ahead, and discussed approaches to 
                            create good questions and scope.</li>
                        <li>Used Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Geopandas, and Plotly to analyze
                            over 8000 entries, visualize, and test data</li>
                    </ul>

                    Thoughts: I think I brought together my leadership experiences of getting things done,
                    supporting the team's learning (Husky Coding Project), into a nice mix of both in 
                    this project.

                    Thoughts: I just dipped my toes in security. I realized that I didn't have the time to
                    prepare adequately for both software engineering and cybersecurity internships,
                    so I went with software. This was fun though!

                <div class="box item">
                    <p class="role">Husky Coding Project Team Leader</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Made web app prototype using the tui-calendar library, node.js. </li>
                    </ul>
    
                    The main priority was creating a valuable learning experience for the team.
                    I learned a lot on how to support the team.
                    I think I should've gone with a different project in Java where we built 
                    from the ground-up so people would be more motivated. I also would've chosen
                    people who perhaps weren't as busy.

                    <p class="role">NASA Artemis (Robotics) Challenge Leader</p>
                    <p style="font-style: italic">July - August 2022</p>
    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Led a team for 20-30 hours a week to build a rover and compete in a
                            course simulating moon conditions.
                        </li>
                        <li>Assembled robot arm for barrier deployment; improved arm, rover, and camera
                            movement with C++ and Python</li>
                        <li>Organized the project by researching all parts the rover needed to request them</li>
                    </ul>
    
                    I learned about more task-oriented leadership, and I really enjoyed this project.
                    It felt complete, despite having only a month. I'm open to learning about hardware
                    and embedded systems.
