                    <p class="role">Backend Software Engineering Intern at Boeing</p>
                    <p style="font-style: italic">June - September 2023</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I implemented the new design for a small-scale data manager using messaging API</li>
                        <li>Improved the design of the configuration framework by 5% with more robust exception handling</li>
                        <li>Skills: AWS (containerized development), Github, C++, unit testing</li>
                    </ul>

                    Thoughts: I appreciate it. It was my first internship, and I'd like to explore other tech stacks.
                            And work at a tech company!

                        <li>Researched data sets on housing prices, planned ahead, and discussed approaches to

                        <li>Used Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Geopandas, and Plotly to analyze

                    </ul>

                    Thoughts: I think I brought together my leadership experiences of getting things done,
                    supporting the team's learning (Husky Coding Project), into a nice mix of both in 
                    this project.

                    Thoughts: I just dipped my toes in security. I realized that I didn't have the time to
                    prepare adequately for both software engineering and cybersecurity internships,
                    so I went with software. This was fun though!
